            <p> <h5>LORD GORING. </h5><br> 
            This one, father.  It is the chair I use myself, when I
            have visitors. <br>  </p>
            
            <p> <h5>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5> <br>  
            Thank ye.  No draught, I hope, in this room? <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <br>  
            No, father. <br> </p>
            
            <p> <h5>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5> <br>  
            Well, sir, it is only ten o’clock.  What is your
            objection to the hour?  I think the hour is an admirable hour! <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <br>  
            Well, the fact is, father, this is not my day for talking
            seriously.  I am very sorry, but it is not my day. <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD CAVERSHAM. </h5> <br> 
            What do you mean, sir? <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD GORING. </h5> <br> 
            During the Season, father, I only talk seriously on the
            first Tuesday in every month, from four to seven. <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD CAVERSHAM. </h5> <br> 
            Well, make it Tuesday, sir, make it Tuesday. <br> </p>

            <p><h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <br> 
            [_Turns round and looks at him_.  PHIPPS _remains
            impassive_.]  Hum!  Any letters, Phipps? </p>

            <p><h5>PHIPPS. </h5> <br> Three, my lord.  
            [_Hands letters on a salver_.]</p>

            <p><h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <br>  
            [_Takes letters_.]  Want my cab round in twenty minutes.</p>

            <p><h5>PHIPPS.</h5> <br>
            Yes, my lord.  <br>
            [_Goes towards door_.] </p>
