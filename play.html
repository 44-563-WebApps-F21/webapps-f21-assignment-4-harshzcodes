        <h3>An Ideal Husband</h3>
        <h4>ACT III.  _The Library of Lord Goring’s House in Curzon Street_.</h4>
        <h4>
            _The Library in Lord Goring’s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
the dominance of form_.

        <p>            
            LORD GORING. <br> 
            This one, father.  It is the chair I use myself, when I
            have visitors. <br>
            
            LORD CAVERSHAM. <br>  
            Thank ye.  No draught, I hope, in this room? <br>

            LORD GORING. <br>  
            No, father. <br>
            
            LORD CAVERSHAM. <br>  
            Well, sir, it is only ten o’clock.  What is your
            objection to the hour?  I think the hour is an admirable hour! <br>

            LORD GORING. <br>  
            Well, the fact is, father, this is not my day for talking
            seriously.  I am very sorry, but it is not my day. <br>

            LORD CAVERSHAM.  <br> 
            What do you mean, sir? <br>

            LORD GORING.  <br> 
            During the Season, father, I only talk seriously on the
            first Tuesday in every month, from four to seven. <br>

            LORD CAVERSHAM.  <br> 
            Well, make it Tuesday, sir, make it Tuesday. <br>

            LORD GORING. <br>  
            But it is after seven, father, and my doctor says I must
            not have any serious conversation after seven.  It makes me talk in my
            sleep. <br>
