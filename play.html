        <h4>
            _The Library in Lord Goring’s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
            the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
            smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
            drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
            some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
            impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
            Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
            intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
            the dominance of form_.
