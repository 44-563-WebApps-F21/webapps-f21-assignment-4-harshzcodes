            This one, father.  It is the chair I use myself, when I
            have visitors. <br>  </p>
            
            <p> <h5>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5> <br>  
            Thank ye.  No draught, I hope, in this room? <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <br>  
            No, father. <br> </p>
            
            <p> <h5>LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5> <br>  
            Well, sir, it is only ten o’clock.  What is your
            objection to the hour?  I think the hour is an admirable hour! <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <br>  
            Well, the fact is, father, this is not my day for talking
            seriously.  I am very sorry, but it is not my day. <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD CAVERSHAM. </h5> <br> 
            What do you mean, sir? <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD GORING. </h5> <br> 
            During the Season, father, I only talk seriously on the
            first Tuesday in every month, from four to seven. <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD CAVERSHAM. </h5> <br> 
            Well, make it Tuesday, sir, make it Tuesday. <br> </p>

            <p> <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> <br>  
            But it is after seven, father, and my doctor says I must
            not have any serious conversation after seven.  It makes me talk in my
            sleep. <br> </p>
