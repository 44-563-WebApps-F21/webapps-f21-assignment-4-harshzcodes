    <p>Oh, why will parents always appear at the wrong time?  Some extraordinary mistake in nature, I suppose.  [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]
        Delighted to see you, my dear father.  [_Goes to meet him_.]</p>

    <h5 class="LordCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>
    <p>Take my cloak off.</p>

    <h5 class="LordGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>
    <p>Is it worth while, father?</p>

    <h5 class="LordCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>
    <p>Of course it is worth while, sir.  Which is the most comfortable chair?</p>

    <h5 class="LordGoring">LORD GORING.</h5>
    <p>This one, father.  It is the chair I use myself, when I have visitors.</p>

    <h5 class="LordCaversham">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h5>
    <p>Thank ye.  No draught, I hope, in this room?</p>
